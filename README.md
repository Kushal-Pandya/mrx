This repo contains some code of some of the tools I've made at my time at Mr. X Inc.

--------------------

- This tool is used to set the correct environment and launch applications. 
- Used as a CLI before
- Using Flask Web Server along with Jquery, AJAX and Boostrap for the GUI

- Done using PySide GUI Building
- Created Mattermost bot integration that does the same thing


Distributed Render Manager:

- This is a tool that allows you to checkout blades in houdini for distributed rendering
- Using SimpleXMLRPCServers and xmlrpclib to acheive a daemon dispatcher to listen to blade
and client
